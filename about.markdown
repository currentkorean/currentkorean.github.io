This website was created to help Korean language learners expand their vocabulary by reading and watching the news.

Reading and watching the news will expose you to the more advanced vocabulary that is used in formal or professional settings. If you want to use Korean in professional settings, or just want to communicate more politely, learning this style of Korean is essential. 

With each article or video I will provide you a list of relevant vocabulary. Study the list before or after viewing the news item, depending on your style of studying. Don't worry if you don't understand 100% of the content right away. With practice you will become more comfortable with the vocabulary and grammar patterns used in formal Korean.

If you have any suggestions on how I can make this site better, please feel free to reach out to me.

Happy studying!
