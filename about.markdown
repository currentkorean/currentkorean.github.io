This website was created to help Korean language learners expand their vocabulary by reading and watching the news.

<h4>Backstory</h4>

This website was born out of my frustration with the lack of Korean language resources available for the intermediate to advanced learner. At this level the learner is more than ready to consume native content, but needs assistance grappling with the massive quantity of vocabulary needed to speak on a wide variety of topics. 

Fortunately, I discovered that reading and listening to the news was an effective way to learn advanced vocabulary and familiarize myself with grammar patterns used in formal Korean. I found this method so helpful I created this website to help others who also want to communicate more professionally in Korean.

<h4>How to Use This Website</h4>

With each article or video I provide a list of relevant vocabulary. Study the list before or after viewing the news item, depending on your style of studying. Don't be surprised if you run across unfamiliar words in the news item, as I have only defined vocabulary related to the topic of the day. 

If you have any suggestions on how I can make this site better, please feel free to reach out to me.

Happy studying!
